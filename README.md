20XX.12.XX : Training camp started. Could not Study.  
20XX.XX.XX : Specialized Training started.  
20XX.XX.XX : Reported for Duty at The First Aviation Brigade, ROKA.  
2021.02.05 : Starting recovery project of my previous knowledge on C and C++. Starting from data structures implementation with c.  
2021.02.06 : Array/vector implementation in C  
2021.02.16 : Data structure implementation / Algorithm revision complete  
2021.02.20 : Recursion studied. planning to revise the C++Primer once i get that delivered to base  
2021.XX.XX : Tough week, Back to studying.  
2021.03.06 : Started Using Groomide, A web-based IDE. Thanks god i can code in the army.
